Welcome to my recipe website!

This website is a demonstration of what I have learned so far using the Odin Project. Basic html will be used to markup a webpage including(but not limited to) recipes to some of my favorite dinners and desserts, with pictures to accomodate them for reference. Again this is a barebones website using basic html for testing/demonstration purposes. Thank you for visiting!
